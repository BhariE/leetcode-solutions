## This is a collection of all my LeetCode solutions written in Java.

My solutions are fully commented for logic.
I solve problems daily as I am looking to improve my problem solving skills.

## Each folder contains:
- A Solution.java folder with commented explanations
- A main() method for local testing

 ## Progress
- 3/100 problems completed
(currently working toward completing 100 LeetCode challenges during November)
